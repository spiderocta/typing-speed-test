    "If you can send a spacecraft to the moon and loop around our natural satellite one time, or—even better—gently set a rover down on the lunar surface, there could be money in it for you. $4.75 million, to be precise.| That is, if you happen to be one of the select few finalist teams competing for the Google Lunar XPrize. The awarding organizations—Xprize and Google—have decided to split two prize amounts between whatever teams manage to achieve two distinct feats:| $1.75 million is up for grabs as part of the Lunar Arrival Milestone Prize. To get a slice of that pie, a “spacecraft must complete one orbit around the moon or enter a direct descent approach to the lunar surface,” according to press materials supplied by XPrize.| A larger chunk—three million dollars—will be split between spacecraft that win the Soft Landing Milestone Prize. To win that, the awarding foundation says that a “spacecraft must transmit data proving it soft-landed on the lunar surface.| Both of those achievements must be met before March 31, 2018, which is also the new deadline by which teams must complete their attempt at the $30 million Grand Prize. The Grand Prize goes to the first team that manages to put a robot on the moon, explore for 500 meters, and send high-def images and video back to Earth. There will also be a smaller prize for the second team to meet those goals. The catch? The teams need to be 90 percent privately funded.| Robotic exploration of our solar system has long been the purview of national space agencies, which spend millions, and sometimes billions of dollars on developing new technologies. The Curiosity Rover, for example, cost about $2.6 billion (not a lot when you consider the length of the mission, but still pretty expensive). This competition is an attempt to find cheaper ways of exploring the space around us. Previous privately funded missions, like 4M back in 2014, have been relatively simple in design—and none have landed on the lunar surface.| Five teams so far have secured contracts to launch their spacecraft; SpaceIL, Moon Express, Synergy Moon, TeamIndus, and HAKUTO. They all have official plans to launch something by the end of 2017, which is going to make for an exciting next few months in space news, but they now have a few extra months to complete their mission.| It’s a sweet prize, but getting a share of the money won’t be easy. After all, it actually is rocket science.",

    "There once was a speedy Hare who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, the Tortoise challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest gathered to watch.| The Hare ran down the road for a while and then paused to rest. He looked back at the tortoise and cried out, 'How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?'| The Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, 'There is plenty of time to relax.'| The Hare and the Tortoise StoryThe Tortoise walked and walked, never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.| The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise that they woke up the Hare. The Hare stretched, yawned and began to run again, but it was too late. Tortoise had already crossed the finish line.| Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.| This is the story that we have all grown up with. But recently, two additions have been proposed to the story.| Addition 1| After being defeated by the tortoise, the hare did some soul-searching. He knew that though he had tried hard in the beginning, he was not consistent, and had grown overconfident. He was determined to undo his mistakes, and invited tortoise for another race. This time, the rabbit was careful to run the whole distance, and of course, emerged the winner.| Moral: Fast and consistent may be better than slow and steady.| Addition 2| Well, after emerging the loser in the second race, the tortoise thought long and hard. He knew that in any traditional terrain, the hare would win, if he was fast and consistent. Therefore, he thought of a non-traditional terrain for the race. Then he invited the rabbit for another race. This time the rabbit laughed out loud, thinking that the tortoise was out of his head. But the tortoise insisted that there should be another race and the terrain would be decided by the tortoise. The rabbit agreed to the idea.| The race began. The rabbit was leading in front, with the tortoise far back trundling along. Around half way through the race, they came across a river. The rabbit halted on the bank of the river, wondering how to cross the river. Meanwhile, the tortoise approached the river slowly, got in to the water, swam across, climbed up on the other bank, ran the last few kilometers, and won the race.| Moral: when your capabilities are below par, choose a playing ground that gives you a natural advantage.",
